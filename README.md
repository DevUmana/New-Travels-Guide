# Name

New Travels Guide

# Description

Our travel guide has been created in hopes that potential tourists/visitors are able to seamlessely navigate between given cities within a Tri-State region. When potential tourists/visitors navigate to a selected city, they are able to learn about the given city and select items of interest that will then be rendered to the landing page to create a list of points of interest for a variety of cities.

# Badges

_On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge._

# Visuals

_Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but chck out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method._

# Installation

_Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection._

# Usage

# Roadmap

# Contributing

As a team, we welcome suggestions, contributions, and constructive feedback to all who are willing to provide.

_For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self._

_You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser._
